# MSP430-Launchpad-Examples
This is a collection of basic code examples for the MSP430G2553.
They would serve as reference so as to quickly get up and running with the MSP430G2553.

## Prerequisites

I've used Code Composer Studio v7.1.0 for compiling these codes.
You would need an MSP430G2553 and its Launchpad MSP-EXP430G2 to run these codes.
